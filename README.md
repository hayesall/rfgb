# RFGB
Developing gradient boosting for relational data


**To run regression:**


1. Copy a regression example from test domains both train and test (for now it is the insurance example) to same directory as the python files

2. Run command: *python main.py -target <list of target(s)> -reg*

3. For the insurance example: python main.py -target [value] -reg


**To run classification:**


1. Copy a classification example from test domains (for now Tic Tac toe or XOR) to same directory as .py files

2. Run command: *python main.py -target <list of target(s)>*

3. For the TicTacToe example: python main.py -target [put,dontput]


**Still in development, pending -> further testing, commenting, cleaning up code and adding more functionality such as advice etc.**
