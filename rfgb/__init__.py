====

Provides
    1. The ability to perform Relational Functional Gradient Boosting (RFGB)
       in Python.

Documentation
-------------

The vast majority of documentation is currently provided in-line with the
code, mostly consisting of high-level overviews and some usage examples.

As this grows in complexity, documentation will likely be found in either
the doc strings for individual functions (i.e. rfgb.__doc__), or online.
