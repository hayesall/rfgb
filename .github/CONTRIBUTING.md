# Contributing

From the BoostSRL Contributing Guidelines:

> Our goal is to push the boundaries of machine learning and statistical relational learning through open development and explainable decision making in both learning and inference. We believe that these are some of the best ways to create trustworthy systems that people can learn from and interract with in their daily lives.

The goal in this project is to match and eventually extend beyond BoostSRL, making these methods easily available to the Python community. Contributions which further this are welcome.
